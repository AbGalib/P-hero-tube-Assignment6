                    Discuss the scope of Var, Let, and Const.

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        <p> 1. var:
                            Function Scope: Variables declared with var are
                            function-scoped. They are accessible throughout the
                            function in which they are declared, including any
                            nested functions.
                            No Block Scope: Unlike let and const, var doesn't
                            have
                            block scope. It means variables declared with var
                            are
                            not limited to the block in which they are declared
                        </p>
                        <p>2. let:
                            Block Scope: Variables declared with let are
                            block-scoped. They are limited to the block in which
                            they are declared, such as if statements, loops, or
                            any
                            block enclosed by curly braces {}.
                            No Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a variable
                            with
                            let in the same scope. However, you can re-assign
                            its
                            value.
                        </p>
                        <p>3. const:
                            Block Scope: Like let, variables declared with const
                            are
                            block-scoped.
                            Constant Value: Variables declared with const are
                            constant. Their value cannot be changed once
                            assigned.
                            However, it's important to note that for objects and
                            arrays, the reference to the object or array remains
                            constant, but the contents can still be modified.

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        <p>null:
                            Explicitly Set Absence of Value: null is used to
                            explicitly set a variable to a value that indicates
                            no
                            value. It represents the intentional absence of any
                            object value.
                            As a Sentinel Value: Sometimes, null is used as a
                            sentinel value to represent an "empty" state or to
                            signify that a variable has not been assigned a
                            value
                            yet.
                        </p>

                        <p>undefined:
                            Default Value: In JavaScript, variables that are
                            declared but not initialized automatically have the
                            value undefined. It's the default value assigned to
                            variables until they are explicitly assigned a
                            value.
                            Indeterminate State: Functions that don't explicitly
                            return a value return undefined.
                            Property Access: When accessing an object property
                            that
                            doesn't exist, JavaScript returns undefined.

                        communication protocol, typically over HTTP.
